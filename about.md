## About us

TurtleSec was founded in Oslo Norway in March of 2018. The founders Dag Fridtun and Patricia Aas, have 15 years of professional experience as software developers each. They have participated in building a wide range of products from browsers to web applications, backend and frontend. Their combined experience of working both in-house and as consultants has made it clear that a central component in making any type of product is trust and empathy.

### Building Relationships
<div class="box">
  <p>
  A product is a reflection on the culture that creates it. Therefore investing in the relationships between people is essential to making a great product. That means building an understanding with your users, forging trust with your customers and being kind and generous with your colleagues.
