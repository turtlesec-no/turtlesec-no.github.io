TurtleSec was founded in Oslo Norway in March of 2018. The founders Dag Fridtun and Patricia Aas have over 25 years of professional experience as software developers between them. They have participated in building a wide range of products from browsers to web applications, backend and frontend. Their combined experience of working both in-house and as consultants have made it clear that a central component in making any type of product is trust and empathy.

### Building Relationships

  <p>
  A product is a reflection on the culture that creates it. Therefore investing in the relationships between people is essential to making a great product. That means building an understanding of the users, forging trust with customers and being kind and generous with your colleagues.
