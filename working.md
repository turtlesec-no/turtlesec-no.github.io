# Working for TurtleSec (Page is in progress)

This page is a work in progress. It is quite long, but it is important to be transparent about how it is to work for TurtleSec. Better navigation on the page will come soon.

## TurtleSec

TurtleSec is a small firm that provides contracting, consulting and training services in the intersection of programming and security. 

### Culture

Our company should be a good place to work and provide the foundation, safety and stability for a good life for all our employees. We are professionals who like to learn and do quality work. But life is more than work, and our primary duty is to our employees and their families.

### What do we do?

Most of our income comes from contracting work (often called consulting in Norway) for clients. The contracts are often regular software development contracts, but we also bring with us our secondary skill-set in security and try to use that to improve our clients security posture. We are focused on programming in a DevOps oriented organisation. Each contract is generally around 3-6 months and are often extended to a year or multiple years. A TurtleSec employee will have a lot of influence on which type of contracting work you would like to do, for which client and the duration you want to stay there.

We also do trainings and workshops primarily in the area of secure programming and culture.

### Who works here?

Today we are three employees, all programmers, two with a strong Java focus and one with a strong C++ focus. We are all senior programmers with between 5 and 15 years of experience.

### How do we influence what we do?

We know that developing and maintaining a skillset is crucial for having a career in tech. We will support you in your development in the direction you'd like to move career wise. We can do this through training, and also through carefully selecting clients that will move you in the direction you would like to go. That includes what kind of technology you work with and what kind of role you take in the client organization. It might also mean giving you training and/or certifying you in technologies that will make that move easier.

### Office

Our office is in an old building from 1880 close to St.Olavs plass in downtown Oslo, Norway. Buses, trams, subways and trains are within walking distance. The office has two roomy team offices with high ceilings, original hardwood floors and crown molding. It also has a meeting room, a kitchen area and a unisex toilet. A shower is in the basement, but this is shared with other tenants. Bicycle parking is in the courtyard which also has a garden. The building and it's neighbor have a lot of artists as tenants, so it is normal to see art laying around.

### Accessibility

The office itself is on the floor above the ground floor of an old building which does not have an elevator. We will try to accomodate any kind of disability including providing the necessary equipment and food adapted to individual needs and/or preferences. 

### Remote

Usually we will work at the clients offices, if the client permits we can also work remotely. How that is structured will depend on the client and the employee. We hope to have regular days where we work from the TurtleSec office so that we can get to know eachother better.

### Travel

As a rule no travel is required, but if the employee has a client that requires travel, all travel, accomodation and meals will be covered by TurtleSec. A TurtleSec employee will not be required to take a client that requires travel.

### Language

All public-facing information at TurtleSec is as a rule in English, informal communication should be adapted to the recipient(s). Clients might require fluent English and/or Norwegian. TurtleSec will facilitate and pay for Norwegian classes if desired by the employee or required by a client.

### Charity

1% of everything we earn is donated to charities in December each year. This has been our policy since the beginning. Which charities we donate to will be decided together with our employees each year.

### Ownership

The company is privately owned by Patricia Aas and Dag Fridtun and has no investors. It has been profitable from the start in 2018.

### Company structure

The CEO of TurtleSec is Dag Fridtun and the Chair of the board is Patricia Aas, they are both also employees and work for clients as all other employees.

## Learning

In a field which requires us to be up to date on technologies that are constantly evolving, it is important to invest in our employees' development.

### Conferences

At least one conference a year as an attendee. As a speaker, more will of course be allowed. Tickets, travel, accomodation and meals that are not covered by the conference will be covered by TurtleSec.

### Training

At least one training a year, more if needed.

### Books or other learning tools

All books or online resources will be covered by TurtleSec.

### Open Source

Employees are encouraged to contribute to OSS and Open Source should be the default for anything we develop outside of client owned software.

### Between clients

A TurtleSec employee that is between clients will receive their regular salary and benefits just like everyone else. They can spend the time improving their competence either through training, certifications and/or work on internal Open Source projects.
