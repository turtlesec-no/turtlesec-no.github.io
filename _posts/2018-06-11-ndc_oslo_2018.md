## Security meets Culture

This year Patricia did two talks at NDC Oslo: "Secure Programming Practices in C++" and "Deconstructing Privilege", the first digging into software vulnerabilities in C and C++ and the second trying to convey how peoples experiences differ and how those directly impact peoples quality of life.

This year was also Patricia's first time on the NDC Oslo Program Committee and she also go to attend Scott Helme's workshop "TLS/HTTPS Security for Web Developers".

## Secure Programming Practices in C++

Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, once said : “C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.” He has also said : “Within C++, there 
is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.” Both are true.

This talk is for programmers wishing to feel more comfortable navigating the C++ landscape. Motivated by going through well known vulnerability patterns that have been used in exploits for decades, we wil
l explore the programming culture that has developed around the C++ language. Specifically, we will look at programming patterns that navigate around or through some of the dangerous parts of the C++ lang
uage. The goal is to build a set of programming practices based in the “smaller and cleaner language” inside C++. And by doing so, we will also build an awareness around code constructs that can potential
ly “blow your whole leg off”.

## Deconstructing Privilege

Can you describe a situation that caused to realize you were privileged? I have asked many people that question now, and what I have learned is that privilege is an Unconscious Incompetence. Being privile
ged is a non-event. When we become conscious of it we realize that our privileged experience is not applicable to less privileged people. What happens to them does not happen to us. Only when we become Co
nsciously Incompetent do we realize the need to listen. We need to learn.
    
In this talk I hope to make you realize that we all have privilege and to start a journey through self reflection to becoming Consciously Incompetent. I hope also to give some indicators and patterns that
 you can look for in your daily lives to recognize and maybe even to correct imbalances you see.
