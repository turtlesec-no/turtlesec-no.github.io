## Mod(C++) Intermediate

_**Mod(C++) Intermediate**_ is a two day training course. It is ideal for people who have some C++
experience or that have taken [_**Mod(C++) Fundamentals**_](../mod-cpp-foundation/).

### More advanced topics

Taken together [_**Mod(C++) Fundamentals**_](../mod-cpp-foundation/) and _**Mod(C++) Intermediate**_
will give a good foundation for a modern C++ programmer.

### Practical information

The exercises will be done in a CMake based project. The students will need a development
environment, a rich IDE is recommended, for example Visual Studio Code and Jetbrains CLion. A GitHub
account will be useful.

Students are assumed to have some C++ experience or should have taken Mod(C++) Fundamentals. They should be working in (
or looking to work in) a C++ project.

### Trainers

The course has been authored by Corentin Jabot and Patricia Aas. Between them they have almost 30 years of experience in
C++, working on everything from games to browsers and embedded.

## Two-day training

The Intermediate course gives the students a deeper understanding of how one should think and program in “Modern C++” (
C++11/14/17/20). The exercises will all be based around a 2D graphics game inspired by Ms. Pac-Man. Topics covered in
the course include:

### Day 1 - Generic programming "thinking"

- Introduction to the training Presentation of the project
- Function overloading
- Operators
- Class templates, function templates, non-type parameters
- Aliases and and alias templates
- std::variant and std::visit
- std::tuple and structured bindings
- Variadic templates, fold expressions and parameter packs

### Day 2 -Modern C++ Features

- Ranges
- std::string_view and std::span
- Constexpr and Consteval
- Concepts
- Special member functions (Rule of Five/Zero)
- Pragmatic introduction to move semantics and return value optimizations
- Safety: Riskier constructs in C++ and how to minimize their impact
- Conclusion and review
