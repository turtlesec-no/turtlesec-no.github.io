## Mod(C++) Intermediate

### More advanced topics

Mod(C++) Intermediate is a two-day training course. It is ideal for people who have
some C++ experience or that have taken Mod(C++) Fundamentals. Taken together these
two courses will give a good foundation for a modern C++ programmer.

### Practical information

The exercises will be done in a CMake based project. The students will need a
development environment, a rich IDE is recommended, for example Visual Studio Code and
Jetbrains CLion. A GitHub account will be useful.

Students are assumed to have some C++ experience or should have taken Mod(C++)
Fundamentals. They should be working in (or looking to work in) a C++ project.

### Trainers

The course has been authored by Corentin Jabot and Patricia Aas. Between
them they have almost 30 years of experience in C++, working on everything from games
to browsers and embedded.

## Two-day training

- Generic programming "thinking"
- Introduction to concepts
- Using parameter packs and fold expressions
- Overloading, operators and special member functions, including Rule of
  Five/Three/Zero
- Pragmatic introduction to move semantics and return value optimizations
- constexpr functions and variables
- Associative containers (std::unordered_map)
- Structured bindings
- C++ 20: Ranges
- Riskier constructs in C++ and how to minimize their impact
- Explaining Undefined Behavior, and how it affects safety and correctness
- Safer handling of pointers, including std::string_view and std::span
