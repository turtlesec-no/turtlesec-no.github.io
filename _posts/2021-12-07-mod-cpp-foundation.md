</ul>

### Introduction to C++

_**Mod(C++) Fundamentals**_ is ideal for people who have little to no experience in C++, but are
proficient in an Object Oriented Programming language, like Java or C#.

_**Mod(C++) Fundamentals**_ should ideally be taken before [_**Mod(C++)
Intermediate**_](../mod-cpp-intermediate/), another two-day course which expands
on the topics in _**Mod(C++) Fundamentals**_. Taken together these two courses will
give a good foundation for a modern C++ programmer.

### Practical information

The exercises will be done in a CMake based project. The students will need a
development environment, a rich IDE is recommended, for example Visual Studio Code and
Jetbrains CLion. A GitHub account will be useful.

Students are assumed to be proficient in an Object Oriented Programming language like
Java or C#. They should be working in (or looking to work in) a C++ project.

### Trainers

The course has been authored by Corentin Jabot, Patricia Aas and Ã“lafur Waage. Between
them they have almost 40 years of experience in C++, working on everything from games
to browsers and embedded.
