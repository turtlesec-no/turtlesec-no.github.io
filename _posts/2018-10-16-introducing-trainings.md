## (In)Secure C++: Understanding Exploitation to Find and Fix Vulnerabilities

_**(In)Secure C++**_ is an interactive 4-day training over where participants will learn the
basis of exploit development to help them view their code from an attackers' perspective. They
will get a good overview of the specs in this area and look at using alternative programming
constructs to replace ones that often occurs in vulnerable code.

## Mod(C++) Fundamentals: Introduction to C++ for Programmers

_**Mod(C++) Fundamentals**_ is a 2-day training tailored to give new hires an introduction to modern
C++. Specifically suitable for people who are already proficient in another programming language.

## Mod(C++) Intermediate: Filling in the gaps

_**Mod(C++) Intermediate**_ is a 2-day training ideal for people that have C++ experience, but feel
that they do not fully understand things like templates, move semantics, concepts or ranges. It is
design to give the students a correct intuition so that they will write code that wields the
language and libraries well.

## My.Code(): Introduction to Programming through Web Development

Interactive training over 4-days where participants will learn fundamental
programming skills with a specific focus on web development. This training does not require that the
participants have any technical background. The final aim is that they can make and maintain a
website dedicated to their interests. This is a training were spreading it in chunks over weeks or
months is a good idea, then the students can practice on their own in between classes.
